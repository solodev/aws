Getting to the Solodev Launchpad is easy. In just a few short steps, you'll be lifting off on AWS.

## Step 1: Subscribe on the AWS Marketplace

Solodev is a professionally managed, enterprise-class Digital Customer Experience Platform and content management system (CMS). Before launching one of our products, you'll first need to subscribe to Solodev on the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B07KMFPW3X/ref=_ptnr_solodev_github_B07KMFPW3X">AWS Marketplace.</a> Click the button below to get started: 
<table>
	<tr>
		<td width="60%"><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B07KMFPW3X/ref=_ptnr_solodev_github_B07KMFPW3X"><img src="images/AWS_Marketplace_Logo.jpg" /></a></td>
		<td><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B07KMFPW3X/ref=_ptnr_solodev_github_B07KMFPW3X"><img src="images/Subscribe_Large.jpg" /></a></td>

## Step 2: Configure Your VPC and EC2 Key Pair
Please note that both a <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Introduction.html">VPC</a> and <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/concepts.html">EC2 Key Pair</a> must be configured within the region you intend to launch your stack. If the following items are already created, you can skip directly to launch.<br/><br />

	</tr>
	<tr>

	</tr>
</table>

<table>

<table>
	<tr>
		<td><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/solodev/AWS-Launch-Pad/master/pages/images/install/options-solodev-cms-pro.jpg" /></td>

<strong>Review</strong><br />
Review all CloudFront details and options. Ensure that the "I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources with custom names" checkbox is selected as well as the "I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might require the following capability: CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND" checkbox. Click on the "Create" button to launch your stack.

<table>
	<tr>
		<td><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/solodev/AWS-Launch-Pad/master/pages/images/install/review-solodev-cms-pro.jpg" /></td>
	</tr>
</table>

## Step 5: Monitor the CloudFormation Stack Creation Process
Upon launching your CloudFormation stack, you will be able to monitor the installation logs under the "Events" tab. The CloudFormation template will launch several stacks related to your Solodev instance including EFS, EDS, and EC2. If you encounter any failures during this time, please visit the <a href="https://github.com/solodev/AWS-Launch-Pad/wiki/Common-Issues">Common Issues</a> page to begin troubleshooting.

<table>
	<tr>
		<td><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/solodev/AWS-Launch-Pad/master/pages/images/install/monitor-solodev-cms-pro.jpg" /></td>
	</tr>
</table>

## Step 6: View CloudFormation Stack Outputs

If your stack builds successfully, you will see the green "CREATE_COMPLETE" message. Click on the primary stack and view the "Outputs" tab. You will find the IP address associated with the Solodev backend. Point both your primary domain (mydomain.com) and a dedicated backend domain/subdomain (solodev.mydomain.com) to this URL.

<table>
	<tr>
		<td><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/solodev/AWS-Launch-Pad/master/pages/images/install/outputs-solodev-cms-pro.jpg" /></td>
	</tr>
</table>

<table>
	<tr>
		<td><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/solodev/AWS-Launch-Pad/master/pages/images/install/dns-solodev-cms-pro.jpg" /></td>
	</tr>
</table>

## Step 7: Login to Solodev

Visit either the IP address or the backend domain you configured in Step 7. Log-in to Solodev using the username "solodev" and the password you configured in Step 5.

<table>
	<tr>
		<td><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/solodev/AWS-Launch-Pad/master/pages/images/install/login-solodev-cms-pro.jpg" /></td>
