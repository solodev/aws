# Solodev Kubernetes for EKS
Launch Amazon Elastic Kubernets Service (EKS) in a new cluster and manage your containers at any scale with Solodev. Launch your applications rapidly and across AWS Regions and Availability Zones, and move from environment to environment regardless of operating system.

## Overview
Solodev Kubernetes for EKS uses a set of YAML templates to create a new EKS cluster. All YAML templates are deployed via <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html">AWS CloudFormation</a>.
